ABOUT THE CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey there! Before you dive into this codebase, a few things to know:

1. HEAVY COMMENTING
   You'll notice a lot of comments. This is intentional! Professor Renato Levy 
   says "you are only as old as the code you maintain" - and I don't want to 
   break my head later wondering why I made certain decisions. Some files even 
   have commented-out code for future reference. This is because 
   I like to keep my code and thought process transparent. I may come back to extend
   this software in the near future to push my understanding and implementation of
   system design and wiser tradeoffs further. So I don't want to curse myself at that time
   nor do I want you to!


2. REQUIREMENT TRACEABILITY
   Many comments reference specific requirements from GreenShoes_Requirements_postCDD.pdf.
   I did this to check off requirements as I built things - it's my way of making 
   sure I didn't miss anything and reminding myself how each piece satisfies the spec.

3. CONVERSATIONAL TONE
   Comments are casual and sometimes verbose - sorry about that! I believe code 
   files are thought journals. Keeping them raw helps my team understand and 
   relate to the logic. Anything that can't be understood can't be handled with care!

4. OCCASIONAL TYPOS
   There might be typos in comments - we're all human! The code itself is tested 
   thoroughly with fallback logic and works fine. I get into flow when coding and 
   commenting, so please don't hold a few spelling mistakes against me!

QUICK NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Admin panel is separate from the customer-facing site
- Auth uses JWT tokens in localStorage (admin_token key)
- All requests go through adminAxios with auto-attached auth
- 401 errors = automatic logout and redirect to login
- Colors/sizes derived from products (no separate tables)
- Sale feature auto-calculates discount percentages

Questions? The code comments should explain most things!
